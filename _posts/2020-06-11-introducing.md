title: Introducing SoloBits

Dev Community has a habit of giving quite a lot for free. I began learning to program from such great devs who kept contributing and sharing their skills and knowledge for free. Today almost after 13 years, I still learn a lot from such great minds who are willing to help and contribute. This is me trying to give back to such a great community by sharing what I’ve learned after coding professionally for 5 years.

### A little background 

I have always been fascinated by what computers could do. From doing simple tasks like downloading something from the internet to playing MetalSlug and Spiderman, I always desired to be someone who could build such programs. I didn't have the option to learn Programming at the School, so I started searching on Yahoo(Yes! I used Yahoo, I was young) how to build software. That’s when I found that computers have languages for communication just like we do. So I just hit a website selected an article and not knowing what most of it meant, I just followed the steps by downloading a bunch of software and copying and pasting the code and whatever was written on it and Voila! it didn’t work… I got errors. Then I went back and picked another article and then another until my copying and pasting worked, as I didn’t know what I was doing. But finally, I was able to build a calculator on the console. That’s how I started.

A few years later I commenced my career as a Freelancer hoping that I’ll soon have a million-dollar idea(still hoping just like all of us). I've Co-founded a Software Solution company, worked as a Contractor, Junior Developer, Senior Developer and now a Team Lead, but I’m still fascinated and deeply in love with what people can accomplish with the computers.

### SoloBits

@SoloBits I’ll be trying to share my knowledge and experience on what I’ve learned and experienced over the years.

Most of it is going to be about Flutter, Lumen(PHP), DevOps, Dev Basics and my experiences. I know I cannot, but I will try to give as much as I’ve taken from the amazing Dev community.

Thanks!
