title: Introducing SoloBits

Dev Community has a habit of giving quite a lot for free. I started learning to program from such great devs who kept contributing and sharing their skills and knowledge for free. Today almost after 13 years I still learn a lot from such great minds who are willing to help and contribute. This is me trying to give back to such a great community by sharing what I've learned after coding professionally for 5 years.

### A little background 

I have always been fascinated by what computers could do. From doing simple tasks like downloading something from the internet to playing MetalSlug and Spiderman I always wanted to be someone who could build such programs. 
Since we were not taught programming at the School so, I stared to search on Yahoo(Yes! I used Yahoo to search, I was young) how to build softwares. That's when I found that computers languages for communication just like we do. So I just picked a website selected an article and not knowing what most of it meant I just followed the steps by downloading a bunch of softwares and copying and pasting the code and whatever was written on it and Voila! it didn't work... I got errors. I still get a lot of those today. Then I went back and picked another article and then another until my copying and pasting worked, as I didn't know what I was doing. But finally I was able to build a calculator on console. That's how I started.
A few years later after taking Software Programming Courses I began my career as a Freelancer. Hoping that I'll soon have a million dollar idea(still hoping just like all of us). I Co-founded a Software Solution company, worked at a startup, worked for an E-commerce company, currently working at a Software House and I'm still fascinated and deeply in love with what people can do with the computers.

### SoloBits

@SoloBits I'll be trying to share my knowledge and experience on whatever I've learned. I think most of it is going to be about Flutter, Lumen(PHP), DevOps, Programming Basics and my experiences. I know I cannot but I will try to give as much as I've taken from the amazing Dev community.

Thanks!
