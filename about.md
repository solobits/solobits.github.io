  FullStack | Mobile App | Flutter | Lumen | Contributer | Learner 
</p>

The name's John... Nelson John. ðŸ˜Ž Flutter and Lumen Shaken, Not Stirred. (I don't care if it makes no sense ðŸ˜›)

The Dev community has given a lot and this website is me trying to give back and contribute to the community. 

I am passionate about programming. Self taught I started programming at the age of 10 using Visual Basic. Writing readable and maintainable code is what I pride myself on. Mobile App development on Android and iOS is what my main interest is. 

I do like messing around a bit in some other languages mainly PHP. PHP is what I started my career on. I still use Lumen by Laravel which is a micro-framework for PHP for building my APIs. I worked on C# for a while building Desktop apps for Windows and Mobile apps using Xamarin but have totally shifted to Flutter now.
Improve my code, productivity, learn and explore new tools is what I always try to do. 
I have recently been trying to share my experience on SoloBits that I think can bring value to other developers and the dev community.
