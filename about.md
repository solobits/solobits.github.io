  FullStack | Mobile App | Flutter | Lumen | Contributer | Learner 
</p>

The name’s John… Nelson John. 😎 Flutter and Lumen Shaken, Not Stirred. (I don’t care if it makes no sense 😛)
The Dev community has given a lot and this website is me trying to give back and contribute to the community.

I am passionate about programming. Self-taught I started programming at the age of 10 using Visual Basic. Writing readable and maintainable code is what I pride myself on. Mobile App Development on Android and iOS is what my main interest is.

I do like messing around a bit in some other languages mainly PHP as that is what I started my career on. I use Lumen by Laravel which is a micro-framework for PHP for building my APIs. I worked on C# for a while building Desktop apps for Windows and Mobile apps using Xamarin but have shifted to Flutter now. Improving my code, productivity and exploring new tools is what I am obsessed with. I have recently been trying to share my experience @SoloBits that I think can bring value to other developers and the dev community.
